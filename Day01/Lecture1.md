🔴 2. Black Hat Hackers (Malicious Hackers)
Purpose: Exploit systems for personal gain or harm.
Work for: Themselves or criminal organizations.
Activities: Spread malware, steal data, perform unauthorized access.

🟡 3. Grey Hat Hackers
Purpose: Explore systems without malicious intent but without permission.
Work for: Themselves (independent).
Activities: May report bugs or vulnerabilities but still break rules.

🔵 4. Blue Hat Hackers
Purpose: Revenge or pre-launch testing.
Work for: Sometimes hired by companies or act independently.
Activities: Security testing for software before release or personal revenge attacks.

🟣 5. Red Hat Hackers (Vigilantes)
Purpose: Fight against black hat hackers.
Work for: Themselves (vigilante-style justice).
Activities: Hack and disable black hats using aggressive methods.

⚪ 6. Script Kiddies
Purpose: Gain attention or fun, using tools created by others.
Work for: Themselves
Activities: Use pre-made scripts or tools to launch attacks with minimal understanding.

⚫ 7. Green Hat Hackers

Work for: N/A (still learning)
Activities: Eager to learn ethical or unethical hacking techniques.

🛡️ Types of Cyber Attacks :

1. Phishing Attack
  🎯 Purpose:
  To trick users into revealing sensitive information (e.g., login credentials, credit card info).

  🧠 How it Works:
  Fake emails or websites mimic trusted entities (banks, companies).
  Users are lured into clicking malicious links or downloading infected attachments.

2. Malware Attack
  🎯 Purpose:
  To infect systems and perform malicious actions like stealing data, spying, or damaging files.

  🧠 Types of Malware:
  Virus: Infects and spreads through files.
  Spyware: Monitors user activity.
  Adware: Displays unwanted ads.
  Ransomware: Locks/encrypts data for ransom.

3. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack
  🎯 Purpose:
  To intercept and possibly alter communication between two parties.

  🧠 How it Works:
  The attacker secretly relays or modifies data between two systems.
  Often occurs on public Wi-Fi or insecure connections.

4. Denial-of-Service (DoS) & Distributed DoS (DDoS) Attacks
  🎯 Purpose:
  To flood a website/server with traffic, making it unavailable.

  🧠 How it Works:
  DoS: Single system floods the target.
  DDoS: Multiple systems (botnets) attack simultaneously.

5. SQL Injection Attack
  🎯 Purpose:
  To manipulate a website's database through malicious SQL queries.

  🧠 How it Works:
   Hackers input SQL code into form fields (e.g., login forms) to extract or modify data.  

8. Zero-Day Attack
  🎯 Purpose:
  To exploit an unknown or unpatched vulnerability.

  🧠 How it Works:
  Attackers find and use a flaw before developers release a fix.
  Extremely dangerous due to lack of defense.
